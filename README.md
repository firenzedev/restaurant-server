# Restaurant server

A simple GraphQL server developed in Java with Spring Boot and the
[GraphQL Kickstart library](https://www.graphql-java-kickstart.com/).

*This is a sample project for educational purposes only.*


## Description

The server exposes some GraphQL APIs that let the user search for a 
restaurant, write a review or reply to an existing review.

It shows some GraphQL queries, some mutations and a subscription.
